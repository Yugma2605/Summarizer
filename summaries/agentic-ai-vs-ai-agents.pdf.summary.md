Summary:
This paper distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, providing a structured taxonomy, application mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges. It characterizes AI Agents as modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation, while Agentic AI systems represent a paradigm shift with multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. The review outlines the architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, and interaction styles of both paradigms, examining challenges like hallucination, brittleness, and coordination failure, and proposing targeted solutions for robust, scalable, and explainable AI-driven systems.

Key Points:
- AI Agents are modular systems utilizing LLMs/LIMs for specific task automation.
- Agentic AI features multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy.
- The paper compares architectural evolution, mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels across both paradigms.
- Challenges include hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure.
- Solutions involve ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, and causal modeling.
- The study provides a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI systems.
